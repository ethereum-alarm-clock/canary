# eac.js

A tool and library to interact with the [Ethereum Alarm Clock](https://github.com/ethereum-alarm-clock/ethereum-alarm-clock) protocol.
You can use the commandline tool for running an execution client or scheduling a transaction.
The library is available to make it easy for developers to get started using the contracts
from their web3 javascript code.

## Documentation

Please see the full [documentation](https://ethereum-alarm-clock.github.io/eac.js/) for instructions on how 
to use `eac.js` commandline tool as well as a full reference of the API library.

## Testing

Run `npm test` at the root of the directory to run the test script on an isolated virtual blockchain using mocha. 

## Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome. Not all functionalities of the Ethereum Alarm Clock smart contracts are translated to this library, it was mostly just utilities needed to write the client and grew from there. If you need some functionality and are not finding it in the API docs, please open a issue or contribute a pull request.

We would love your feedback if you get stuck somewhere or you think something is not working the way it should be. Please open an issue if you need to report a bug or would like to leave a suggestion. Pull requests are welcome.
